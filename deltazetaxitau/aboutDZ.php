        <h1>Our Purpose</h1>
        <p>It was the founding of Delta Zeta Sorority, whose purpose is to create among a group of women a true and lasting friendship, to encourage one another in the pursuit of knowledge, to promote values-based living and embrace social responsibility.<br><br>Each of us wants to make friends, learn new things and do something that matters. It’s part of the human experience. You might say it’s in our DNA, but that doesn’t make it any easier to do. But in 1902, six young women formed an organization that would help them move these ideas forward.</p>
